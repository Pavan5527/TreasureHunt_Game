
## GENERAL INFORMATION AND SCOPE OF THE PROJECT :-

This is a Treasure Hunt Game titled - <ins>**'Mystery Mansion'**</ins>, which is used to test the different soft skills of the users. The basic scope and target of this application is to analyze the thinking ability, attention to detail and the focus power of the users. This game/puzzle interacts with the users in a seamless and effective manner, so as to provide the best user experience. By playing this game, the users get to know their own capabilities and cognitive skills, which they can sharpen so as to apply them in the corporate world.

## TECHNICAL INFORMATION :-

    i) Frontend and Backend Informtation :-

        1) This application is created using HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose.js, EJS and Three.js.
        2) I have used the MongoDB Atlas Database to store the data of the users who play the game.
        3) Node.js is used to create the Frontend as well as the Backend.
        4) Express.js is used to create a server for the Backend.
        5) Mongoose.js has been used to establish a connection between Node.js and MongoDB Atlas.
        6) I have used the EJS Template Engine to create the files for the Frontend as well as importing data from the MongoDB Atlas into my project.

    ii) Game Logic Information :-
    
        1) I have used the Three.js technology to create the logic of the Treasure Hunt Game.
        2) The controls of the Game are defined in the 'virtualjoystick.js' file. We can control the game using the mouse and the trackpad.
        3) Multiple images of different objects have been used in the game, these images are present in the 'items' folder.
        4) The CSS of the game is defined inside the 'game-style.css' file.
